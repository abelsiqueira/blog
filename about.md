My name is Abel, I'm a professor at the Federal University of Paran√°.
[My professional page](/) has information
about that part of my life.
This blog serves as a collection of things I find useful, things I find
interesting and random posting.

Some posts are in brazilian portuguese, mostly those that do not provide
international interest.
